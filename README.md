Prerequisites
Before deploying the application, make sure you have the following:

A cloud account on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or DigitalOcean (for hosting the app on a public server).
Basic knowledge of using PHP, file transfers, and terminal commands.
An SSH key for secure access to the server (optional but recommended).
Installation
Step 1: Download the Project Files
Go to the GitHub page for the calendar project: PHP Calendar Project on GitHub.
Download the calendar folder as a ZIP file.
Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.
Step 2: Set Up a Local PHP Environment
If you'd like to test the application locally:

Make sure PHP is installed:

bash
Copy code
php -v
Navigate to the calendar folder:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/calendar
Start a PHP local server:

bash
Copy code
php -S localhost:8000
Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the calendar app.

Deployment
To deploy this application on a public server, follow these steps.

Step 1: Set Up a Cloud Instance
Create an account with a cloud provider of your choice (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or DigitalOcean).
Create a new instance (Ubuntu is recommended) using the provider’s free tier options.
Connect to the instance using SSH:
bash
Copy code
ssh username@your-instance-ip
Step 2: Install Apache and PHP on the Server
Run the following commands to install Apache and PHP on your server:

bash
Copy code
# Update the package list
sudo apt update

# Install Apache
sudo apt install apache2 -y

# Install PHP
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
Step 3: Transfer the Project Files
Transfer the files from your local machine to the server’s Apache root directory using scp:

bash
Copy code
scp -r /path/to/local/calendar/* username@your-instance-ip:/var/www/html/
Step 4: Set Permissions
Ensure that the Apache user has permissions to access the files:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
Step 5: Restart Apache
After uploading the files, restart Apache to load the application:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Accessing the Application
Once deployed, you can access the application via your server’s public IP address:

arduino
Copy code
http://your-instance-ip/
Replace your-instance-ip with the actual IP address of your server.
